Write a program to multiply two matrices, Cn×q = An×pBp×q. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the
problem.

1. Define n = 5, p = 3, and q = 4.
2. Declare three arrays A, B, and C of type double or real.
3. Initialise the C to zero and
(a) Ai j = i + j,
(b) and Bi j = i − j.
4. Use the schematic below to determine the elements of C.
5. Print out the three arrays (with one row of the matrix per line) to the screen and ensure that
you are generating the correct result.
6. If you have time create two files a main and matmult function. Have matmult return C to
main.
7. Construct a Makefile that will compile the two files to generate the executable.
