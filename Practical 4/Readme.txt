Calculate the tan(x) values where x is in radians in the range [0, 60] every five degrees.
Place the results in an array. Print the array. Make the array a global variable.

1. Use the function (or subroutine) to convert degrees to radians.
2. Construct main, in main have a loop where the loop counter does 0, 1, 2 ....12.
3. Use the loop counter to generate the degree angles.
4. Use the function to generate the radian values.
5. Compute tan(x), store in the array.
