For this exercise, you need to have Conversion.c.
	1. Compile the program.
	2. Notice that as we explained in the lectures the floating point and integer presentations do
	not give the correct result.
	3. How many binary digits are there in the number and how many can a float/real represent.
	4. Letâ€™s say we want to check the number of binary digits. Construct an expression in the code
	that will do this.
	5. For C use the function log f , which is part of the maths library.
	6. For FORTRAN use the intrinsic function log.

For this exercise use Sum.c.
	1. Complete the code to make the sum
		1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .........+ 1/1000

	2. Print out the difference between the two sums.
	3. Is there a difference between sum1 and sum2 and are the two sums mathematically the same
	or not?
