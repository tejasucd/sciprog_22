Computing the area under the curve of f (x) where x ∈ [a, b] can be done using the Trapezoidal
rule: 	a∫b	f (x)dx ∼ (b − a/2N )( f (x0) + 2 f (x1) + 2 f (x2) +......... + 2 f (xN−1) + f (xN ))
where x0 = a and xN = b with N − 1 equidistant points between a and b.

The integral is changed into a sum, using the values of the function at certain points. Increasing
the number of points increases the accuracy.

Find the integral of f (x) = tan(x) from 0 →π/3. Compare with the actual result: 0∫π/3 tan(x)dx =log(2).

1. So a = 0 and b =π/3.
2. Get the firt part of the sum tan(0) + tan(π/3). For C use tan which is part of the maths
library. You used the maths library in the last practical for Conversion.c. tan is available in
FORTRAN by default.
3. Create a loop that generates 11 equidistant points between 0 →π/3. Thus N = 12 and x0 = a = 0 and x12 = b =π/3.
4. Change the loop so that you are adding 2 tan(xi) for the each of the 11 points.
5. Add that sum to that of the end points and multiply by b−a/2N .
6. Compare this against log(2) you should not be too far out.
